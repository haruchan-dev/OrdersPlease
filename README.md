# Orders Please!
## Description:
Step into the bustling world of a food street vendor! Customers with rumbling stomachs and specific cravings will appear, barking their orders in a flurry. Can you decipher their requests and whip up their desired dishes before the timer runs out? The faster you complete orders, the more customers flock your stall, and the faster they leave, satisfied and full. But be warned, miss too many orders and your loyal patrons will slip away, leaving you with a pile of uneaten food and a deflated reputation.

## Genre:
Fast-paced Food Order Game

### Mechanics:
Customers arrive with their orders, displayed for a limited time.
Match their order by selecting the corresponding food from your stall.
Each order has a timer; complete it before the timer runs out to satisfy the customer.
Unfulfilled orders lead to disgruntled customers who leave, and the next one arrives in their place.
After completing 15 orders, the timer for each order speeds up, increasing the challenge.
The game ends either when you successfully complete a set number of orders or miss a total of five.

### Features:

- Diverse customers with unique food preferences.
- Engaging timer mechanic that keeps the action fast-paced.
- Progressive difficulty ramp-up to test your skills.
