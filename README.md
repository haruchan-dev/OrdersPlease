# Orders Please!
## Description:
You’re a street food vendor on campus, where your job is to satisfy students’ cravings for delicious street food, but against the clock. Time is of the essence, so keep track of each customer’s request to ensure their hunger is satisfied with culinary delight.

## Genre:
Simulatiom

### Mechanics:
Customers arrive with their orders, displayed for a limited time.
Match their order by selecting the corresponding food from your stall.
Each order has a timer; complete it before the timer runs out to satisfy the customer.
Unfulfilled orders lead to disgruntled customers who leave, and the next one arrives in their place.
After completing 15 orders, the timer for each order speeds up, increasing the challenge.
The game ends either when you successfully complete a set number of orders or miss a total of five.
